Architecture of the neural net consists of two layers of neurons, 
connected by directional weighted connection paths.

Bidirectional associative memory neural nets can respond to input
to either layer.

The connections between the layers are bidirectional; i.e., if the
weight matrix for signals (correlation matrix) sent from the Input-layer to the Output-layer is M, 
the weight matrix for signals sent from the Output-layer to the Input-layer is MT.
